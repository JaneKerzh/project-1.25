      <h2>re-<br>
        introducing<br>
        classical music<br>
        in Rotterdam</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="music">
      <p>through the years, classical music has been associated with higher social classes and exclusiveness. unwritten rules and restrictions have been created around it, making the music experience itself the least important.</p>

      <p>in 2021, it can be possible for anyone to access the world of the classical tradition and participate in its continuation, without belonging in any of the privileged groups. the individuals who already have the means to participate, could also benefit from a re-introduction of what music experience can be.
        </p>
      <p>there is no need for audiences to sit still with fear; fear of not understanding the piece, making a sound, and seeming disrespectful by not giving a standing ovation to a mediocre performance. however, when rules like these are unreasonably implied, a barrier between the music and the audience is formed. by recognising current cultural patterns and the psychological impact of a live music performance, simple and sensible solutions can be found.</p>
      <p>the classical music scene yearns for a change. composers, musicians, audiences and, generally, participants who do not see themselves in the large concert hall setting, crave another way to connect with the music and the community around it.</p>
    </div>
    <div id="podium">
      <p>undercurrent is an initiative aiming to make this change possible by offering a simple way which unfolds in three main streams:</p>

      <p>1.podium</p>
        <p>classical music is best experienced by being close to the -acoustic- instruments. undercurrent is a stage where the audience and
        the music are not separated from each other. by programming local musicians, students of conservatories, as well as professional
        performers and by prioritising sustainability over profit making, we promote an inclusive way of participating in classical music.</p>

      <p>2.school</p>
          <p>music education can be painless and engaging. our approach is rooted in centering the student's desire to learn, being efficient
          by respecting human psychology and being effective by following a proven systematic curriculum. the close collaboration between
          the music school and podium provides an opportunity for students to gradually be initiated into realistic performing environments
          as well having unforgettable experiences full of fun and meaning.</p>

        <p>3.cafe</p>
          <p>imagine a place where you can spend hours, work or study, have a piece of mind, see friends, connect with classical music and
          have a drink. the cafe is intended to support the other two streams by providing an inviting space and quality, seasonal, local
          food and drinks to the students, audience, performers and other visitors.</p>
