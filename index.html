      <h2>re-<br>
        introducing<br>
        classical music<br>
        in Rotterdam</h2>
    </div>
    <div id="music">
      <p>through the years, classical music has been associated with higher social classes and exclusiveness. unwritten rules and restrictions have been created around it, making the music experience itself the least important</p>

      <p>music industry centers and promotes only a handful of names, commercializing and profiting from their work without developing in sustainable and educational directions, which creates large gaps between the composers, performers and the audience.</p>
      <p>in 2021, it can be possible for anyone to access the world of the classical tradition and participate in its continuation, without belonging in any of the privileged groups. the individuals who already have the means to participate, could also benefit from a re-introduction of what music experience can be.
        </p>
      <p>there is no need for audiences to sit still with fear in their eyes; fear of not understanding the piece, making a sound, and seeming disrespectful by not giving a standing ovation to a mediocre performance. keeping silent and focused for hours, expressing gratitude and admiration, could come naturally to us. however, when rules like these are unreasonably implied, a barrier between the music and the audience is formed. by recognising current cultural patterns and the psychological impact of a live music performance, simple and sensible solutions can be found.</p>
      <p>the classical music scene yearns for a change. composers, musicians, audiences and, generally, participants who do not see themselves in the large concert hall setting, crave another way to connect with the music and the community around it. threefour is an initiative aiming to make this change possible by offering a simple, inclusive and sustainable way of participating in classical music.</p>
