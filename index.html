          introducing<br>
          classical music<br>
          in Rotterdam</h5>

      <p>classical music</p>

      <p>through the years, classical music has been associated with
        higher social classes and exclusiveness. unwritten rules and
        restrictions have been created around it,
        making the music experience secondary and difficult.</p>

      <p>there is no need for audiences to sit still with fear; of not
        understanding the piece, making a sound, and seeming disrespectful
        by not giving a standing ovation to every performance. however,
        when rules like these are unreasonably implied, a barrier between
        the music and the audience is formed.</p>

      <p>by recognising current cultural
        patterns and the psychological impact of a live music performance,
        simple and sensible solutions can be found.</p>

      <p><b>re-introduction</b></p>

      <p>in 2021, it can be possible for anyone to access the world of the
        classical tradition and participate in its continuation, without
        belonging to any privileged group. the individuals, who already have
        the means to participate, could also benefit from a fresh perspective
        on what music experience can be.</p>

      <p>the classical music scene yearns for a change; audiences, composers, performers and, generally,
        participants who do not see themselves in the large concert hall setting, crave another,
        simpler, modest and sincere environment to connect with the music and the community around it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="podium">
      <p>undercurrent is an initiative aiming to make a change in the
        classical music scene by offering a simple solution which unfolds in 3
         main streams:</p>

      <p><b>1. podium</b></p>

        <p>classical music is best experienced by being close to the -acoustic- instruments.
          undercurrent is a stage where the audience and the music are not separated from each other.
          by programming local musicians, students of conservatories, as well as professional performers
          and by prioritising sustainability over profit making, we promote an inclusive way of participating in classical music.</p>

      <p><b>2. school</b></p>

        <p>Music education can be painless and engaging. Our approach is rooted in centering the student's desire to learn,
          being efficient by respecting human psychology and being effective by following a proven systematic curriculum.
          The collaboration between the music school and podium provides an opportunity for students to gradually be
          introduced to real performing environments as well as having cool experiences full of fun and meaning.</p>

        <p><b>3. café</b></p>

        <p>imagine a place where you can spend hours, work or study, have a piece of mind, see friends,
          connect with classical music and have a drink. the café is intended to support the other two streams by providing
          an inviting space and quality, seasonal, local food and drinks to the students, audience, performers and other visitors.</p>
