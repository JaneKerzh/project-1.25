        introducing classical music, in Rotterdam
      </h3>

      <h5>classical music</h5>

      <p>through the years, classical music has been associated with higher social classes and exclusiveness.<br>
        unwritten rules and restrictions have been created around it, making the music experience secondary and difficult.</p>

      <p>there is no need for audiences to sit still with fear; of not understanding the piece, making a sound, and seeming disrespectful by not giving a standing ovation.<br>
        however, when rules like these are unreasonably implied, a barrier between the music and the audience is formed.</p>

      <p>by recognising current cultural patterns and the psychological impact of a live music performance, simple and sensible solutions can be found.</p>

      <h5><b>re-introduction</h5></p>

      <p>in 2021, <br>
        it can be possible for anyone to access the world of the classical tradition and participate in its continuation, <br>
        without belonging to any privileged group.</p>

      <p>the classical music scene yearns for a change; <br>
        audiences, composers, performers and, generally, participants who do not see themselves in the large concert hall setting, <br>
        crave another, simpler, modest and sincere environment to connect with the music and the community around it.</p>
    </div>

    <div id="podium">

      <h5>1. podium</h5>

        <p>classical music is best experienced by being close to the -acoustic- instruments.<br>
          undercurrent is a stage where the audience and the music are not separated from each other.<br>
          by programming local musicians, students of conservatories, as well as professional performers <br>
          and by prioritising sustainability over profit making, <br>
          we promote an inclusive way of participating in classical music.</p>

      <h5>2. school</h5>

        <p>music education can be painless and engaging.<br>
          our approach is rooted in centering the student's desire to learn, being efficient by respecting human psychology <br>
          and being effective by following a proven systematic curriculum.<br>
          the collaboration between the music school and podium provides an opportunity for students to gradually be introduced <br>
          to real performing environments as well as having cool experiences full of fun and meaning.</p>

        <h5>3. café</h5>

        <p>a place where you can spend hours, work or study, have a piece of mind, see friends, connect with classical music and have a drink.<br>
          the café is intended to support the other two streams by providing an inviting space and quality, seasonal, local food and drinks.</p>
